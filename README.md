# AdventOfCode2018
This is my personal Advent of Code 2018 project space. I have not done any of the prior year's challenges and my first attempt is in F#. It has been a few years since I have done any real coding in F# so the code here is likely not going to be the best example of F#. While I am try to follow functional programming best practices I am quite rusty. Explore at your own risk!
