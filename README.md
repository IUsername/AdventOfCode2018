# AdventOfCode2018
This is my personal Advent of Code 2018 project space. This is my first year attempting the challenge and I decided to code in F#. It has been a few years since I have done significant work in F# so the code here is not going to be a shining example of F#. I am quite rusty. Explore at your own risk!
